                            <p> is a natural protected area in the South Moravian Region. Although it is relatively
                                small in size, it's bursting with natural splendour. It lures travellers with its
                                unspoiled charm, ubiquitous tranquillity, breathtaking views and hundreds of rare
                                species of fauna and flora. <br><br>
                                The symbol of Podyjí National Park is a black stork, gorgeous bird nestling in the
                                natural reserve every summer. Moreover, the Podyjí is a wildlife sanctuary for tens of
                                species of mammals. The river shores are inhabited by otters and beavers, while the
                                shadows of the dense mixed coniferous forests offer a refuge for roe deers, foxes or
                                wild boars.<br><br>

                            <p>Olomouc is a major city in Moravia and the capital of the administrative region of the
                                same name. It is the sixth largest city in the country and the most important city in
                                the Haná region of Moravia .<br><br>
                                Its well preserved Old Town belongs to the most beautiful ones in Czechia and boasts a
                                UNESCO World Heritage Site. It attracts many domestic and foreign tourists, but the city
                                still seems somewhat underrated. If you like visiting charming historic cities and don’t
                                like the kind of crowds that you’ll see e.g. in Prague, then Olomouc may be a perfect
                                destination for you.<br><br>

                            <p>Praděd is a mountain in the Hrubý Jeseník range, on the border of the Moravian-Silesian
                                and Olomouc Regions. The mountain peak itself is situated in Czech Silesia and in the
                                Moravian-Silesian Region. The border between Silesia and Moravia runs below the peak.
                                With its elevation of 1,491.3 m (4,893 ft) above sea level, it is the highest mountain
                                in Czech Silesia and Moravia, and the fifth-highest in the whole of Czechia.<br><br>
                                There is a 162 m (531.49 ft) tall broadcasting tower on the peak. The tower houses a
                                small hotel and a restaurant. There is also an observation platform in the tower. Thanks
                                to the tower, the silhouette of the mountain is very easily recognizable. When the
                                visibility is good, Praděd can be seen from very faraway places, even from some
                                locations in Poland.<br><br>
